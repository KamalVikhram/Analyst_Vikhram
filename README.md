My Personal Repository

📊 Data Analyst (in transition) | 🐍 Python Enthusiast | 💡 Creative Problem-Solver

I specialize in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling—transforming raw datasets into actionable insights that help solve real-world problems. My toolkit includes Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Power BI, and Excel, and I’m constantly expanding my skills into machine learning and advanced analytics.

🚀 What I Do
📊 Data Analytics – Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets
📈 Data Visualization – Crafting interactive dashboards & reports (Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🐍 Python Programming – Automating workflows, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling
🛠 Problem-Solving Mindset – Applying structured thinking & creativity to find insights that matter

🎨 Creative Edge (My 3D Artist Background)
Before diving into data, I worked as a 3D Artist, building high-poly photorealistic models and low-poly assets for AR/VR. This background sharpened my:
🔍 Attention to detail – ensuring precision in data handling
🎨 Creativity – designing intuitive visualizations and reports
⚡ Optimization mindset – streamlining workflows and resources

🎯 Current Mission
